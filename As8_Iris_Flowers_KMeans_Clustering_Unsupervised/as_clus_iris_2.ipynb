    "## Unsupervised learning using KMeans clustering \n",
    "\n",
    "## Predicting Clusters\n",
    "\n",
    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "On completing this assignment, you will be able to write a simple AI unsupervised application using KMeans clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In the last assignment, you were provided with iris data set that had 5 columns including the species column. That assignment used a few of those columns. In this assignment, you will use another set of columns and they are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns to be used\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "petal_length, petal_width\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models to be used\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following model:\n",
    "\n",
    "KMeans of sklearn.cluster module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of clusters to be produced\n",
    "\n",
    "For KMeans, specify 3 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### After KMeans is trained\n",
    "\n",
    "After KMean is done with training do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- print the cluster\n",
    "- print the cluster centers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work on species column\n",
    "\n",
    "Species column contains the true labels. So do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify the encoding sequence say in variable maplist and then, in accordance with that sequence, encode the contents of species column from three species name to numbers (0, 1, and 2) using the OrdinalEncoder\n",
    "- Print the encoded values\n",
    "- Make sure that the list of encoded values of species is similar to the list of cluster numbers produced by KMeans for data items. Otherwise, try encoding using a different sequence of values in the maplist variable.`\n",
    "\n",
    "  \n",
    "#### Compare the true label against the cluster number produced by KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the true labels against the predicted label by printing the follow:\n",
    "\n",
    "- number of items successfully classified\n",
    "- accuracy score\n",
    "- classification report\n",
    "- confusion matrix\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graphically show the following\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphically show all data items as points in a scatter graph in three different colors representing different clusters produced by KMeans model.\n",
    "- Obtain the locations of three cluster centers (centroid) from KMeans, and show them in the above graph with the symbol X.\n",
    "- Also, in another graph, show all data items as points in a scatter graph in three different colors representing three different species per true labels.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Compare the performance Of unsupervised learning ofKMeans with supervised learning of SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the performance of KMeans with SVM classifier as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code that will perform supervised learning with SVC classifier of sklearn.svm module with the same data using petal_length and petal_width columns as features and species column as labels. Use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing and produce accuracy score.\n",
    "- Compare the accuracy score of KMeans with that of SVC.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
