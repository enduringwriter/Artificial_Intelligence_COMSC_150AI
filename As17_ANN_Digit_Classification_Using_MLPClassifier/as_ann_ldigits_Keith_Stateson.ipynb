    "- The arrays, images and target, are numpy arrays\n",
    "- The shape of array images is (60000, 28, 28). So, the array contains 60000 images and each image is 28 by 28 two dimensional array.\n",
    "- The array target is a one dimensional array and it contains integers, varying in values between 0 and 9 and these values correspond to images stored in array images. Above, when we display the first element of target array, it is 5. Below, we display the first image in array images and it is an image of 5. See below.\n",

    "\n",
    "- We should leave the array target as it is and use it for target values\n",
    "- We should also leave the array images as it is and use it for displaying images with matplotlib.pyplot or plt as shown above.\n",
    "- Using array images of shape (60000, 28, 28), we should create another array named data_flat of shape (60000, 784) (where 784 = 28 * 28) by simply reshaping the array images. This would make each image to be a one dimensional array of size 784 containing 784 pixel values and we would be able to use those image values as input to neural networks.

So, the values of converted array data_flat_norm will vary from 0 to 1. Since, data_flat is a numpy array, we can accomplish this in single step as shown in the code below. We also display the values of one element of the converted array, data_flat_norm, to check that our method worked. (In neural networks, we normalize values because it usually improves performance.)\n",

    "##### Summary\n",
    "This assignment involves building an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using the MLPClassifier from Scikit-learn's neural_network module. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately recognize and classify images of digits (0-9). The assignment includes steps such as loading and preprocessing the data, building and training the model, evaluating its performance, and conducting experiments to optimize the model's parameters.\n",
    "\n",
    "Assumptions\n",
    "The dataset comprises images and their corresponding labels stored in images.pkl and targets.pkl. The input images are 28x28 pixels in size and need to be flattened for input into the neural network. Normalization of pixel values (0-255) to a range of 0-1 improves the performance of the neural network. The MLPClassifier is suitable for this classification task and can be optimized through experimentation with different parameters.\n",

    "he MLPClassifier class from skikit-learn library was used to build a neural network model for image classificaion. The model performance was optimized by adjusting the hyperparameters e.g., the number of hidden layers, the learning rate, and the number of iterations. Other hyperparameters can also be modified e.g. the number of neurons in each layer. The model performed well regarding overfitting of training and testing data, thus, no overfitting adjustments were needed.\n",

    "Metrics were conducted to assess model accuracy, which performed well. Having learned to use the MLPClassifier classifier to train a neural network model on the MNIST dataset, which contained images of handwritten digits, the model can now be applied to recognize handwritten digits with a high degree of accuracy.\n",
