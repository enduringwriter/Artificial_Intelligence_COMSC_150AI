    "## Objectives\n",
    "\n",
    "On completing this assignment, you will be able to write a simple AI unsupervised application using KMeans clustering.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Description\n",
    "\n",
    "In this assignment, you will use KMeans of sklearn.cluster module to produce 3 clusters using 2 columns of penguin data set as features. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Data set to be used for KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following data set:\n",
    "\n",
    "penguin.csv\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Read the data set as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "df=pd.read_csv('penguin.csv',index_col=0)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Columns to be used\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following columns:\n",
    "\n",
    "bill_length_mm,\tbill_depth_mm\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Models to be used for KMeans\n",
    "\n",
    "Use the following algorthm:\n",

    "KMeans of sklearn.cluster module\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Number of clusters to be produced\n",
    "\n",
    "For KMeans, specify 3 clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### After KMeans is trained\n",
    "\n",
    "After KMean is done with training, do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- print the cluster\n",
    "- print the cluster centers\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Work on species column\n",
    "\n",
    "Species column contains the true labels. So do the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Specify the encoding sequence say in variable maplist and then, in accordance with that sequence, encode the contents of species column from three species name to numbers (0, 1, and 2) using the OrdinalEncoder\n",
    "- Print the encoded values\n",
    "- Make sure that the list of encoded values of species is similar to the list of cluster numbers produced by KMeans for data items. Otherwise, try encoding using a different sequence of values in the maplist variable.`\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Graphically show the following\n",
    "\n",
    "- Graphically show all data items as points in a scatter graph in three different colors representing different clusters produced by KMeans model.\n",
    "- Also, in the same above graph, show three cluster centers (centroid) obtained from KMeans with the symbol X.\n",
    "- Also, in another graph, show all data items as points in a scatter graph in three different colors representing three different species per true labels.\n",

    "- accuracy score\n",

    "- In another graph, show all data items as points in a scatter graph in three different colors representing three different species per true labels.\n",

    "#### Compare the performance of unsupervised learning ofKMeans with supervised learning of SVM\n",
    "\n",
    "Compare the performance of KMeans with SVC classifier as below:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Write code that will perform supervised learning with SVC classifier of sklearn.svm module with the same data using bill_length_mm, bill_depth_mm columns as features and species column as labels. Use 80% of the data for training and 20% for testing and produce accuracy score.\n",
