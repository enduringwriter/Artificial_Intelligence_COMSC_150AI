    "On completing the assignment, you will learn how to write a simple AI supervised classification application.\n",

    "#### Description\n",
    "\n",
    "Write an AI application which, when provided with a person's demographic, financial, and personal attributes such as age, salary, years employed etc., will predict a person's suitability for credit card issuance. For training and testing the application, please use the labeled dataset provided in the file, k_creditcard.csv. The dataset contains data regarding 9709 individuals. Each person is labeled as either suitable (assigned Target value of 1) or unsuitable (assigned Target value of 0). Use 80% of the data items for training, and the remaining 20% for testing. Train the sklearn's KNeighborsClassifier classifier with parameter n_neighbors set to 5. After the classifier is trained, test it using the test data and produce accuracy score, classification report, and confusion matrix. Then, optionally try out a few self-created individual values and note the application response. \n",

    "Machine learning algorithms typically require numerical input. Categorical data needs to be converted into a numerical format.\n",

This is done to avoid the dummy variable trap, which occurs when the dummy variables are perfectly collinear. By dropping the first category, you remove this redundancy. For example, if you have a categorical variable with three categories, A, B, and C, get_dummies will create three columns (A, B, C).
