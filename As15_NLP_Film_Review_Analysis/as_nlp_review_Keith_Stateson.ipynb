    "##### Summary\n",
    "This assignment focuses on the application of Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to perform film  review analysis. The task involves preprocessing text data, vectorizing it using the Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF) method, and employing machine learning models to classify the reviews into different categories. The models used for classification are evaluated based on various performance metrics, and the results are visualized using confusion matrices and other relevant plots.\n",

    "In Summary, the model is overfitting and the grid search did not improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "Text analysis was added to the code to analyze the text data. The text analysis showed that the average sentence length is 26 words and the average word length is 4.5 characters. The sentence length distribution showed that the maximum sentence length is 56 words and the minimum sentence length is 1 word. The sentence length distribution plot showed that most sentences have a length of 10 to 20 words.\n",
    "\n",
    "With Text analysis, we can adjust the hyperparameters to improve the model. We can also use other techniques such as increasing the number of training samples, reducing the number of features, increasing the number of samples, using regularization, using dropout, using cross-validation, using early stopping, and using a simpler model to improve the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictions are mostly correct, but there are some false positive predictions. The false positive predictions are due to the model's inability to understand the context of the text. For example, 'I will never watch it again' is a negative review, but the model predicts it as a positive review. Similarly, 'Best trash movie in past 10 years' is a negative review, but the model predicts it as a positive review.\n",
    "\n",
    "To improve the model, we can explore other techniques such as deep learning models like LSTM or BERT, which can better understand the context of the text. LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network that can capture long-term dependencies in the text data. BERT is a transformer-based model that can capture bidirectional context in the text data. These models can improve the model's performance by better understanding the context of the text data."
