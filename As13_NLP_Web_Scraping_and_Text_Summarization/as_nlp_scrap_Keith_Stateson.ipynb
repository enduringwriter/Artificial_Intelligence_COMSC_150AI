    "Write an AI application that will scrape a Wikipedia article on Neural Networking from the Internet and will summarize it by selecting the three most relevant sentences which are less than 20 words long from the article.\n",

    "This program is an AI application designed to summarize a given Wikipedia article on Neural Networking by web scraping the content. The program uses Beautiful Soup to scrape and parse the article from the Internet, extracting the three most relevant sentences, each containing fewer than 20 words. \n",

    "The different sentence length limits (15, 25, and 30) did not significantly alter the outcome. This may imply that most sentences in the text fall within the shorter length limits, or the high-scoring sentences are inherently short.\n",
    "\n",
    "One possible reason is the dataset used in this example is relatively small, and the majority of the sentences are of similar length. As a result, the algorithm may have difficulty distinguishing between the importance of different sentences. In a larger dataset with more diverse sentence lengths and structures, the variations in the summaries may be more pronounced.\n",

    "Considering the sentence scoring and text analysis, medium length sentences (15-30 words) seem to contain more substantial information and context, making them valuable for summaries. They strike a balance between detail and conciseness."
